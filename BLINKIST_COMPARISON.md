## What we built (Blinkist-style + deeper + tailored to you)

| Blinkist | DeepSummarizer (this app) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| 7–8 key ideas, ~200–300 words each | **Same** (Key ideas) **plus** one sentence + 30-sec quick take + full deep summary + bullets + verdict + founder takeaways |
| ~15 min total | **Layered**: 10 sec (one sentence) → 30 sec (quick take) → key ideas → full narrative → bullets → “Should I read?” → Rene-specific takeaways |
| General reader | **Tailored to you**: Kinnect, three-sided medical marketplace, healthcare, operator/entrepreneur, markets |
| Human-curated library | **Any source you give**: paste, PDF, URL, podcast title (we find transcript) |
| Follow-up Q&A in app | **Research** page: ask a question, get an answer, save to Notion as Research / Q&A |
| Save/organize in app | **Save to Notion** with auto Area, Topic Tags, Content Type |
| Audio | **TTS** + browser speech for summary/key ideas |

So: we include **all** the Blinkist-style layers (one sentence, quick take, key ideas, full summary) and add **deeper** narrative, **verdict**, and **founder takeaways** tailored to you, plus Notion and Research.

## Reno Times format

The daily newspaper is **TL;DR-first**: every section starts with a headline-style TL;DR, then bullets or short paragraphs only when needed, plus “So what for you” and “What could happen next.” See **RENO_TIMES_SPEC.md**.
