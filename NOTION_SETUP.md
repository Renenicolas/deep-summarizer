# Notion integration – setup guide

**Use the full guide:** **[NOTION_SETUP_AND_EMBED.md](./NOTION_SETUP_AND_EMBED.md)** for step-by-step setup, embed, and confirmation that **Save to Notion** auto-fills Area, Topic Tags, Content Type, and Date.

**Create the database once** using the spec and Notion AI prompt in **[NOTION_DATABASE_SPEC.md](./NOTION_DATABASE_SPEC.md)** so property names and options match what the app expects.

This file is kept for backward compatibility; follow the two links above for the current flow.
