# Research – how to use

The **Research** feature lets you ask a question and get a clear, structured answer. The AI is tuned for Rene (founder, three-sided medical marketplace) and will tie answers to your company, markets, and decisions when relevant.

## What the AI does

- Answers in plain language and breaks down complex concepts.
- When relevant, explains how the answer affects: Kinnect, markets, macro, personal life, entrepreneurship, or finance.
- If something is time-sensitive or needs real-time data, it will say so (e.g. “For the latest numbers, check …”).
- Does not invent facts; if unsure, it says so.

For fully up-to-the-minute data (e.g. today’s stock price or a breaking news event), you may still need to check a live source; the research answer is best for concepts, frameworks, and “how does X work” type questions.
